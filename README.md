Lancet Digital Health Paper: CT derived radiomic score for predicting the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery in stage I, II resectable non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective multicohort study for outcome prediction

In this work, we have developed a Radiomics Based risk score (QuRiS) for predicting diasease-free survial (DFS) and added benefit of adjuvant-chemotherapy for Early-Stage non-small cell lung cancer patients.
