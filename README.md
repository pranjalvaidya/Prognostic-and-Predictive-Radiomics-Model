Lancet Digital Health Paper: CT derived radiomic score for predicting the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery in stage I, II resectable non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective multicohort study for outcome prediction

In this work, we have developed a Radiomics Based risk score (QuRiS) for predicting diasease-free survial (DFS) and added benefit of adjuvant-chemotherapy for Early-Stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. 

NOTE: The following codes are provided for research purpose only. The authors have no responsibility for any consequences of use of these source codes. If you use any part of the codes, please cite the following paper.


The file tited as "Sample.csv" is the file containing patients (rows) along with features (columns). 
The first code, QuRiS constrcution would construct a Radiomics based score and would store in the file titled as "dataset_train".


Model Parameters that can be adjusted:
QuRiS construction 
â€¢	Alpha = 0-ridge regression, 1-LASSO regression

The score can be constructed with any dataset if dataset is formed as per the sample csv file.
